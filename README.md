# Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNN)
Done by @NEGU93 - J. Agustin Barrachina

This is a library that uses [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) as a back-end to do complex-valued neural networks as, as far as I know, CVNNs are barely supported by Tensorflow and not even supported yet for [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/755) (reason why I decided to use Tensorflow for this library).

Please [Read the Docs](https://complex-valued-neural-networks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## About me & Motivation

[My personal website](https://negu93.github.io/agustinbarrachina/)

I am a PhD student from [Ecole CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)
with a scholarship from [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [DGA](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga)

I am basically working with Complex-Valued Neural Networks for my PhD topic.
In the need of making my coding more dynamic I build a library not to have to repeat the same code over and over for little changes and accelerate therefore my coding.
