Description: # Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNN)

        This is a library that uses [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) as a back-end to do complex-valued neural networks as, as far as I know, CVNNs are barely supported by Tensorflow and not even supported yet for [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/755) (reason why I decided to use Tensorflow for this library).

        ## About me & Motivation
        
        [My personal website](https://negu93.github.io/agustinbarrachina/)
        
        I am a PhD student from [Ecole CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)
        with a scholarship from [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [DGA](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga)
        
        I am basically working with Complex-Valued Neural Networks for my PhD topic.
        In the need of making my coding more dynamic I build a library not to have to repeat the same code over and over for little changes and accelerate therefore my coding.
